# AI Voice Assistant Project

Welcome to the AI Voice Assistant project! This project focuses on creating an intelligent voice assistant with advanced capabilities, including dynamic interaction, voice commands, and an interactive GUI resembling a responsive animated sphere or blob. The assistant adapts to various states such as speaking, listening, idle, or displaying specific emotions.

## Features

- **Real-Time Voice Interaction**: The assistant can process and respond to voice commands in real time.
- **Memo Management**: Can take notes of what user says and recall based on that memory. 
- **Modular Design**: The project is structured with modular code, ensuring maintainability and scalability.
- **Interrupt Feature**: The assistant can handle interruptions during its response. (Upcoming)
- GUI under development.

## Getting Started

Instructions for setup will be uploaded as soon as project gets ready for public use.
